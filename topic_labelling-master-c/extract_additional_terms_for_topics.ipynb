      "391125 Regasification is a process of converting liquefied natural gas (LNG) at −162 °C (−260 °F) temperature back to natural gas at atmospheric temperature. LNG gasification plants can be located on land as well as on floating barges. Floating barge mounted plants have the advantage that they can be towed to new offshore locations for better usage in response to changes in the business environment. In a conventional , LNG is heated by sea water to convert it to natural gas / methane gas. In addition to regasification, many valuable industrial byproducts can be produced using cold energy of LNG. Cold energy of LNG utilisation for extracting liquid oxygen and nitrogen gas from air, makes LNG-regasification plants more viable when they are located near integrated steel plants and/or urea plants. Cold energy of LNG usage in lieu of massive and energy intensive cryogenic refrigeration units in natural-gas processing plants is also more viable economically. The natural gas processed with cold energy of LNG and the imported LNG can be readily injected into a conventional natural gas distribution system to reach the ultimate consumers. The cold energy of LNG can be used for cooling the exhaust fluid of the gas turbine which is working in closed joule cycle with Argon gas as fluid. Thus near 100% conversion efficiency to electricity is achieved for the LNG/natural gas consumed by the gas turbine as its exhaust heat is fully used/absorbed for the gasification of LNG. However, the abundant availability of natural gas, and the mature technology and its acceptability in using the LNG directly (without regasification) in road and rail vehicles would lead to lesser demand for LNG regasification plants.\n",

Since 1946 it belongs - along with the monastery - to the historic buildings of Łódź. The church of St. Anthony of Padua was built between 1701–1723. It was consecrated on 16 May 1726, by Primate Teodor Potocki, Archbishop of Gniezno. For the next decades, the Franciscan church served as a center of worship for the local Catholics, especially for the pilgrims. In January 1902, when the new parish was created in Łagiewniki, under the pastoral care of the local Franciscans, the church of St. Anthony of Padua become a parish church. Nowadays, the Franciscan church is known as one of the oldest Baroque buildings in Łódź, and not only as a place of prayer. Every summer musical concerts are organized here, and many young couples decide to arrange a wedding ceremony here. The Baroque church was built on a plan of the sign of the Latin cross. The facade of the church is two storied. Inside the church there are many valuable elements: main altar (Baroque) of St. Anthony of Padua, chapel of blessed Raphael Chyliński with his coffin, side altars (renovated), Baroque wooden ambo with St. Francis of Assisi painting, etc. Also, there are some valuable paintings and chasubles in the sacristy of the church.\n",

They include corticosteroids, which consist of glucocorticoids like cortisol and mineralocorticoids like aldosterone, adrenal androgens like dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (A4), and neurosteroids like DHEA and DHEA-S, as well as pregnenolone and pregnenolone sulfate (P5-S). Adrenal steroids are specifically produced in the adrenal cortex. Adrenal steroids are distinguished from \"gonadal steroids\", which are steroids that are derived from the gonads and include sex steroids such as progestogens like progesterone, potent androgens like testosterone, and estrogens like estradiol. Adrenal androgens like DHEA and DHEA-S are transformed locally into potent androgens like testosterone and/or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in various tissues such as the skin, hair follicles, prostate gland, breasts, vagina, and others. Such tissues have all of the enzymes, including 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), 5α-reductase, and steroid sulfatase (STS), necessary to transform adrenal androgens like DHEA and DHEA-S into testosterone and/or DHT. Androstenedione and testosterone originating from the adrenal glands can also be aromatized into the estrogens estrone and estradiol, respectively, in various tissues. Transformation of adrenal androgens into potent androgens and estrogens is involved in sebum production, skin oiliness, acne, pubic and body hair growth, hirsutism, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and other functions and conditions.\n",

      "715924 Oncology is a branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. A medical professional who practices oncology is an \"oncologist\". The name's etymological origin is the Greek word ὄγκος (\"ónkos\"), meaning \"tumor\", \"volume\" or \"mass\" and the word λόγος (\"logos\"), meaning \"study\". Cancer survival has improved due to three main components including improved prevention efforts to reduce exposure to risk factors (e.g., tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption), improved screening of several cancers (allowing for earlier diagnosis), and improvements in treatment. Cancers are often managed through discussion on multi-disciplinary cancer conferences where medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, and organ specific oncologists meet to find the best possible management for an individual patient considering the physical, social, psychological, emotional, and financial status of the patient. It is very important for oncologists to keep updated with respect to the latest advancements in oncology, as changes in management of cancer are quite common. Screening is recommended for cancers of breast, cervix, colon, and lung. Signs and symptoms usually depend on the site and type of cancer. Diagnostic and staging investigations depend on the site and type of malignancy. Blood investigations including hemoglobin, total leukocyte count, platelet count, peripheral smear, red cell indices. Bone marrow studies including aspiration, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridisation and molecular studies. Excision biopsy of lymph node for histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry, and molecular studies. Blood investigations include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum uric acid, and kidney function tests. Imaging tests such as computerised tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET CT). Bone marrow biopsy. Biopsy for histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Imaging tests like X-ray, ultrasonography, computerised tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET CT. Endoscopy including Naso-pharyngoscopy, Direct & Indirect Laryngoscopy, Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, Colonoscopy, Cystoscopy. Tumor markers including alphafetoprotein (AFP), Beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG), Carcinoembionic Antigen (CEA), CA 125, Prostate specific antigen (PSA). Treatment depends on the site and type of cancer. It includes Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL): Includes acute and chronic leukemias. Acute leukemias includes acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Chronic leukemias include chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).\n",

      "416337 The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the human nervous system: Human nervous system – the part of the human body that coordinates a person's voluntary and involuntary actions and transmits signals between different parts of the body. The human nervous system consists of two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS contains the brain and spinal cord. The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which are long fibers that connect the CNS to every other part of the body. The PNS includes motor neurons, mediating voluntary movement, the autonomic nervous system, comprising the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system and regulating involuntary functions, and the enteric nervous system, a semi-independent part of the nervous system whose function is to control the gastrointestinal system. The central nervous system (CNS) is the largest part of the nervous system, and includes the brain and spinal cord. Brain – center of the nervous system. Principal regions of the vertebrate brain: Peripheral nervous system (PNS) – nervous system structures that do not lie within the CNS. A sensory system is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing sensory information. A sensory system consists of sensory receptors, neural pathways, and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception. Glial cells, commonly called neuroglia or glia, are supportive cells that maintain homeostasis, form myelin, and provide support and protection for the brain's neurons. A neuron (also known as a neurone or nerve cell) is an excitable cell in the nervous system that processes and transmits information by electrochemical signaling. Neurons are the core components of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. An action potential (or nerve impulse) is a transient alteration of the transmembrane voltage (or membrane potential) across the membrane in an excitable cell generated by the activity of voltage-gated ion channels embedded in the membrane. The best known action potentials are pulse-like waves that travel along the axons of neurons. Synapses are specialized junctions through which neurons signal to each other and to non-neuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands. Neurotransmitter – endogenous chemical that relays, amplifies, and modulates signals between neurons and other cells to which they are synaptically connected. Neurotransmitter receptor – membrane receptor that can be activated by a neurotransmitter. Interactions between neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors can evoke a wide range of differing responses from the cell receiving the signal, including excitation, inhibition, and various types of modulation. Biological neural network – population of physically interconnected neurons that act cooperatively to form a functional circuit. Computer scientists and engineers also study artificial neural networks formed by simplified mathematical abstractions of the signaling properties of biological neurons. Neural development – comprises the processes that generate, shape, and reshape the nervous system, from the earliest stages of embryogenesis to the final years of life. Eye development Motor control – comprises the activities carried out by the nervous system that organize the musculoskeletal system to create coordinated movements and skilled actions. Memory – organism's ability to store, retain, and recall information. \"Learning\" means acquiring new knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, preferences or understanding, and may involve synthesizing different types of information. Cognition – activities involved in processing information, applying knowledge, and changing preferences. Cognition, or cognitive processes, can be natural or artificial, conscious or unconscious. Arousal – physiological and psychological state of being awake or reactive to stimuli. Central nervous system Peripheral nervous system\n",

      "357493 Durvalumab (trade name Imfinzi) is an FDA-approved immunotherapy for cancer, developed by Medimmune/AstraZeneca. It is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) with the PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1) molecules. Durvalumab is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who either have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Durvalumab is known as a checkpoint inhibitor drug. The list price for the drug from AstraZeneca is $180,000 for a year. A phase 1B clinical trial of durvalumab and tremelimumab showed some activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phase 1 data in advanced metastatic urothelial bladder (Study 1108) has led to FDA breakthrough therapy designation. Early results of a phase I trial combining durvalumab and gefitinib in lung cancer patients \"showed promise\". A Phase 1 clinical trial is currently underway using durvalumab with a TLR 7/8 agonist (MEDI 9197) for solid tumors. A Phase 1b/2a trial is underway combining durvalumab with an HPV DNA vaccine (MEDI 0457) in patients with HPV-associated recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer. In July 2017, AstraZeneca announced that a phase III trial of durvalumab with tremelimumab as a first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer failed to meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival. In November 2017, the double-blinded phase 3 AstraZeneca PACIFIC clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of durvalumab in the treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer. 709 patients with stage III NSCLC who did not have disease progression after two or more cycles of a platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive durvalumab or a placebo as consolidation therapy for their lung cancer. Durvalumab increased the median progression-free survival from 5.6 months (placebo) to 16.8 months (durvalumab); the 12 month progression-free survival rate was increased from 35.3% (placebo) to 55.9% (durvalumab), and the 18 month progression-free survival rate was increased from 27.0% (placebo) to 44.2% (durvalumab). The median time to death or distant metastases was also increased from 14.6 months (placebo) to 23.2 months (durvalumab). Extreme side effects were also increased from 26.1% of patients (placebo) to 29.9% of patients (durvalumab).\n",
